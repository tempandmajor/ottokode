STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...

# Supabase Configuration (Production)
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key

# AI Provider Keys (Optional - users can provide their own)
REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
REACT_APP_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=...

# Environment
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Database Migrations
1. Run all migrations in order:
   ```sql
   supabase/migrations/01_initial_schema.sql
   supabase/migrations/02_rls_policies.sql
   supabase/migrations/03_functions.sql
   supabase/migrations/04_monitoring_tables.sql
   ```

2. Verify RLS policies are active:
   ```sql
   SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity
   FROM pg_tables
   WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND rowsecurity = false;
   ```

### Stripe Setup
1. ✅ Products created with correct pricing
2. ✅ Webhook endpoint configured
3. ✅ Required events enabled:
   - `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
   - `checkout.session.completed`

## 🔒 Security Configuration

### Content Security Policy
```
default-src 'self';
script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' blob:;
style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com;
font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com data:;
img-src 'self' data: blob: https:;
connect-src 'self' https://*.supabase.co https://api.openai.com https://api.anthropic.com https://*.stripe.com;
```

### Rate Limiting
- 100 requests per minute per authenticated user
- Automatic cleanup of expired tokens and rate limit data

### Input Validation
- All user inputs validated and sanitized
- File upload restrictions and type checking
- Code execution sandboxing (Tauri security model)

## 📊 Monitoring Setup

### Required Monitoring Tables
- `application_logs` - Application logging
- `application_metrics` - Performance metrics
- `security_events` - Security incident logging
- `error_reports` - Error tracking
- `performance_metrics` - Performance monitoring

### Health Checks
- Database connectivity
- AI provider API status
- Payment processing status
- File system access

## 🚢 Deployment Steps

### 1. Build Application
```bash
# Run the production setup script
./scripts/setup-production.sh

# Or manually:
npm install
npm run build
npm run tauri build
```

### 2. Deploy Backend API
- Deploy API endpoints to your hosting provider
- Configure webhook endpoints for Stripe
- Set up SSL certificates

### 3. Configure Web Server
Example Nginx configuration:
```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    # SSL configuration
    ssl_certificate /path/to/ssl/cert;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/ssl/key;

    # Security headers
    add_header X-Frame-Options DENY;
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;
    add_header Referrer-Policy strict-origin-when-cross-origin;

    # Serve frontend
    location / {
        root /path/to/dist;
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }

    # API proxy
    location /api {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3001;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```
