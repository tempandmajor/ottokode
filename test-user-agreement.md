# User Agreement Testing Guide

## Testing Checklist

### Desktop App Testing
1. **First Launch (No Agreement Accepted)**
   - [ ] App shows welcome screen instead of main interface
   - [ ] User agreement modal appears automatically
   - [ ] Modal requires scrolling to bottom to enable acceptance
   - [ ] "I have read and understand" checkbox must be checked
   - [ ] Accept button is disabled until both conditions met
   - [ ] Declining agreement attempts to close the app

2. **After Accepting Agreement**
   - [ ] App proceeds to main IDE interface
   - [ ] Agreement status is saved locally
   - [ ] Subsequent launches skip the agreement modal

3. **Version Update Simulation**
   - [ ] Change agreement version in `user-agreement-content.ts`
   - [ ] Launch app again - should show agreement modal for new version
   - [ ] Old acceptance status should be considered invalid

### Web App Testing
1. **User Agreement Page**
   - [ ] Navigate to `/user-agreement`
   - [ ] Page shows current agreement status
   - [ ] Can view full agreement in modal
   - [ ] Can accept agreement from web interface
   - [ ] Status updates reflect acceptance

2. **Modal Functionality**
   - [ ] Agreement modal can be triggered from web interface
   - [ ] Full agreement content displays properly
   - [ ] Scrolling and checkbox requirements work
   - [ ] Accept/decline functionality works

3. **Footer Link**
   - [ ] Footer contains "User Agreement" link
   - [ ] Link navigates to `/user-agreement` page

### Cross-Platform Consistency
1. **State Synchronization**
   - [ ] Agreement acceptance status is consistent between platforms
   - [ ] LocalStorage/IndexedDB properly stores agreement data
   - [ ] Platform detection works correctly

2. **Content Verification**
   - [ ] Same agreement content shows on both platforms
   - [ ] Version numbers and dates are consistent
   - [ ] All 12 sections of agreement display properly

   # Launch the built app
   open /Users/emmanuelakangbou/ai-ide/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/Ottokode.app
   ```

2. **Web App**:
   ```bash
   # Start development server
   npm run dev
   # Visit http://localhost:3001/user-agreement
   ```

3. **Clear State Between Tests**:
