/*
 * DEPRECATED: This component has been replaced by DesktopAuthScreen
 *
 * Old desktop authentication flow with built-in sign-in/sign-up forms.
 * This pattern does not match industry standards (Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)
 *
 * NEW PATTERN:
 * - Users authenticate via web browser first
 * - Desktop app receives authentication via callback/redirect
 * - No built-in forms in desktop app
 *
 * Use: src/components/auth/DesktopAuthScreen.tsx instead
 *
 * This file is kept for reference and will be removed in a future version.
