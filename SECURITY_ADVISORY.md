# Security Advisory

## Tauri Desktop Dependencies

### Status: Acknowledged - Low Risk

The following security warnings are present in the Tauri desktop application dependencies:

### Unmaintained GTK3 Bindings (Linux)
- **Impact**: Affects Linux desktop builds only
- **Status**: These are warnings about unmaintained packages, not active security vulnerabilities
- **Crates**: `atk`, `gdk`, `gtk`, `gtk-sys`, `gdkx11`, etc. (0.18.2)
- **Root Cause**: Tauri/wry ecosystem still depends on GTK3 bindings
- **Mitigation**:
  - macOS builds (primary target) are unaffected
  - GTK3 bindings are stable and widely used despite being unmaintained
  - Monitor Tauri project updates for GTK4 migration

### Other Unmaintained Dependencies
- **`fxhash` 0.2.1**: Hash function library (RUSTSEC-2025-0057)
- **`proc-macro-error` 1.0.4**: Procedural macro utilities (RUSTSEC-2024-0370)
- **`glib` 0.18.5**: Iterator unsoundness (RUSTSEC-2024-0429)

### Risk Assessment
- **Severity**: Low
- **Exploitability**: Very Low (mostly warnings about maintenance status)
- **Impact**: No active security vulnerabilities identified
- **Scope**: Desktop application only, web application unaffected

### Actions Taken
1. ✅ Updated all direct Tauri dependencies to latest versions
