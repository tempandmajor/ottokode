# Desktop App Troubleshooting Guide

## üîç **What to Check Now**

### **1. Icon Issue Debugging**

**Check if your new icons are actually in place:**
```bash
ls -la /Users/emmanuelakangbou/ai-ide/src-tauri/icons/
```
- Look at the file sizes and dates
- Make sure they're your new logo files, not the old ones

**Check if the app was built with new icons:**
```bash
ls -la /Applications/Ottokode.app/Contents/Resources/
```
- Should show your icon files

**Manual icon verification:**
1. Right-click on `/Applications/Ottokode.app`
2. Select "Get Info"
3. Look at the icon in the top-left of the info window
4. If it's still old, the icon files weren't properly updated

### **2. Scrolling Issue Debugging**

**Open Developer Tools in the desktop app:**
1. Launch Ottokode desktop app
2. Right-click anywhere in the app
3. Select "Inspect Element" or "Inspect"
4. Go to the "Console" tab
5. Look for these debug messages:
   - "Desktop Redirect Debug:" - shows platform detection
   - "Scroll event:" - shows if scrolling is detected
   - "Is at bottom:" - shows scroll position detection

**What the console should show:**
```
Desktop Redirect Debug: {isDesktop: true, pathname: "/desktop", ...}
```

If `isDesktop: false`, the platform detection isn't working.

### **3. Route Debugging**

**Check which page is actually loading:**
1. In the developer console, type: `window.location.pathname`
2. Should show: `"/desktop"`
3. If it shows `"/"`, the desktop route isn't loading

### **4. User Agreement Modal Testing**

When the user agreement appears:
1. **Try the debug button**: Click "(Debug: Mark as scrolled)"
2. **Check the checkbox**: "I have read and understand"
3. **Accept button should enable** if both are done

## üõ†Ô∏è **Quick Fixes to Try**

### **For Icon Issues:**

**Option 1: Nuclear approach**
```bash
# Logout and login to clear all macOS caches
# This is the most reliable way to clear icon cache
```

**Option 2: Different icon format**
```bash
# Replace the icon files with different file names temporarily
cd /Users/emmanuelakangbou/ai-ide/src-tauri/icons/
mv icon.png icon-old.png
mv icon.icns icon-old.icns
# Copy your new logo as icon.png and convert to .icns
# Then rebuild
```

### **For Scrolling Issues:**

**Option 1: Force development mode testing**
```bash
cd /Users/emmanuelakangbou/ai-ide
npm run tauri:dev
```
This launches in development mode where you can see real-time console logs.

**Option 2: Simplify the modal**
If scrolling still doesn't work, we can temporarily remove the scroll requirement.

### **For Route Issues:**

**Check Tauri configuration:**
```bash
cat /Users/emmanuelakangbou/ai-ide/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json | grep -A 10 "windows"
```
Should show `"url": "desktop"`

## üîß **What I Suspect is Happening**

### **Icon Issue:**
- macOS is very aggressive with icon caching
- Your new icons might not have replaced the old ones properly
- The app might be getting built with old cached icons

### **Scrolling Issue:**
- The desktop app might not be loading the `/desktop` route
- Platform detection might not be working
- The modal might be loading but scroll events aren't firing

## üìã **Information I Need**

Please check and tell me:

1. **Icon Files:**
   ```bash
   ls -la /Users/emmanuelakangbou/ai-ide/src-tauri/icons/ | grep -E "(icon\.|32x32|128x128)"
   ```

2. **Console Output:**
   - Open DevTools in the desktop app
   - Share what's in the Console tab

3. **Current URL:**
   - In the desktop app console, type: `window.location.href`
   - Share the result

4. **Platform Detection:**
   - In the console, type: `window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__`
   - Share if it shows an object or undefined

This will help me identify exactly what's going wrong and fix it properly.
